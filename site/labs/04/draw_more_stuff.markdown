# Draw Stuff Lab!

In this lab, you'll be drawing three objects:

1. a face (again)
2. circles and squares

Some logistics:

* __save all of these in your mtec1002-lab04 folder first!__
* __save as the name of the thing that you're drawing__

## face_var
{% highlight java %}
// draw a green face with two eyes and a mouth (symmetrical)
// all x and y values must be relative to an x and y variable
// (that is, they are defined by x and y)
// the size of the face should be 150, 150
// again, x and y parameters to ellipse must be variables!
// make them all relative to each other

{% endhighlight %}

## circles_squares
{% highlight java %}
// draw alternativing circles and squares
// use a for loop
// and a conditional
// using mod will help alternate
// each should be 20 pixels apart
// each square should be 40 x 40
// each square should be yellow
// each circle should have a diamater of 40
// each circle should be blue
