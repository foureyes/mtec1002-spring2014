# Draw Stuff Lab!

In this lab, you'll be drawing three objects:

1. a face (again)
2. circles and squares

Some logistics:

* __save all of these in your Desktop/username (your first initial, last name) folder first!__
* __save as the name of the thing that you're drawing__

## face_var

### Instructions
{% highlight java %}
// draw a green face with two eyes and a mouth (symmetrical)
// all x and y values must be relative to an x and y variable
// (that is, they are defined by x and y)
// the size of the face should be 150, 150
// again, x and y parameters to ellipse must be variables!
// make them all relative to each other
{% endhighlight %}

### Using Git
{% highlight java %}
#1.create a repository on github named face_var
#2. keep the url handy... it should be something like: https://github.com/foureyes/face_var.git
#3.once you've finished your program, go to your folder (first initial, last name) in terminal:

git init
git add --all
git commit -m 'initital commit for...'
git push origin master

{% endhighlight %}

### Making a Change
* Change the color of the face that you made
* use git add, commit and push to github when you're done

## circles_squares

### Instructions
{% highlight java %}
// draw alternativing circles and squares
// use a for loop
// and a conditional
// using mod will help alternate
// each should be 20 pixels apart
// each square should be 40 x 40
// each square should be yellow
// each circle should have a diamater of 40
// each circle should be blue

{% endhighlight %}

### Using Git
{% highlight java %}
#1.create a repository on github named circles_squares
#2. keep the url handy... it should be something like: https://github.com/foureyes/circles_squares.git
#3.once you've finished your program, go to your folder (first initial, last name) in terminal:

git init
git add --all
git commit -m 'initital commit for...'
git push origin master

{% endhighlight %}

### Making a Change
* Change your code so that the pattern is repeated vertically
* use git add, commit and push to github when you're done
