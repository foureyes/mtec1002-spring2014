=====

Count by twos from 2 through 20.  You should use a for loop to do this.  If the number is divisible by 4, print "I'm busy counting" and add that many exclamation points to it.  Finally, count how many of those numbers were divisible by 4, and print it out.

Example Output:

2
I'm busy counting!!!!
6
I'm busy counting!!!!!!!!
10
I'm busy counting!!!!!!!!!!!!
14
I'm busy counting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
18
I'm busy counting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5 numbers were a multiple of four
