## Instructions

Note that __ALL OF THESE FILES MUST BE CREATED IN THE REPOSITORY THAT YOU CREATED FOR THIS LAB__.

### cake

Write a program that asks the user if they want cake.  Based on the response, it will output a different message to the JavaScript Console.

* using SublimeText, create a new file called __cake.html__ in your repository directory: __~/Desktop/jversoza/lab-06-javascript-conditionals/__
* setup an html file, and add script tags... start writing your JavaScript between the script tags
* the program should ask: "Do you want cake?"
* based on the user's input:
	* print out "Have some cake." if the user says exactly "yes"
	* print out "No cake for you" if the user says anything other than "yes"
* example interaction is below (everything after the greater than sign (&gt; is user input using the prompt function):
{% highlight bash %}
# Run 1
(prompt) Do you want cake?
> yes
Have some cake.
# Run 2
(prompt) Do you want cake?
> maybe
No cake for you.
{% endhighlight %}
* save your file in SublimeText
* use status, add commit and push to save your file in version control and submit it
* modify your program so that the program accepts no as an answer, and says something different if it is not yes and not no:
	* print out "Have some cake." if the user says exactly "yes"
	* print out "No cake for you." if the user says exactly "no"
	* print out "I don't understand." if the user types anything else"
* example interaction is below (everything after the greater than sign (&gt; is user input using the prompt function):
{% highlight bash %}
# Run 1
(prompt) Do you want cake?
> no
No cake for you
# Run 2
(prompt) Do you want cake?
> maybe
I don't understand
{% endhighlight %}
* save your file in SublimeText
* use status, add commit and push to save your file in version control and submit it

* using SublimeText, create a new file called __spanish.html__ in your repository directory: __~/Desktop/jversoza/lab-06-javascript-conditionals/__
* setup an html file, and add script tags... start writing your JavaScript between the script tags
* the program should ask for a word: "Give me a word in English..."
* based on the user's input:
	* output "gato" if the user says "cat"
	* output "pero" if the user says "dog"
	* output "caballo" if the user says "horse"
	* output "no se" if the user says anything else
