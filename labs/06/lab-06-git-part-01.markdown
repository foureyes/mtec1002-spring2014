### temperature

Write a program that calculates celsius to fahrenheit based on user input.

* using SublimeText, create a new file called __temperature.html__ in your repository directory: __~/Desktop/jversoza/lab-05-javascript/__
* setup an html file, and add script tags... start writing your JavaScript between the script tags
* the program should ask for the temperature in celsius
* find the formula for celsius to faahrenheit conversion online!
* translate that formula into javascript 
* the program should output to the __JavaScript console__: c degrees celsius is f degrees fahrenheit
* (obvs with f and c substituted with the appropriate calculated values)
* example interaction is below (everything after the greater than sign (&gt; is user input using the prompt function):
{% highlight bash %}
(prompt) Please enter a temperature in celsius
> 37
37 degrees celsius is 98 degrees fahrenheit
{% endhighlight %}
* save your file in SublimeText
* use status, add commit and push to save your file in version control and submit it

### miles

Write a program that calculates miles-per-gallon based on user input for miles driven and gallons of gas used.

* using SublimeText, create a new file called __miles.html__ in your repository directory: __~/Desktop/jversoza/lab-05-javascript/__
* setup an html file, and add script tags... start writing your JavaScript between the script tags
* miles-per-gallon (mpg) can be calculated using the following formula... 
* mpg = miles driven / gallons of gas used 
* ask the user for the number of miles driven and the gallons of gas used
* calculate miles-per-gallon and output the result to the JavaScript console
* example interaction is below (everything after the greater than sign (&gt; is user input using the prompt function):
{% highlight bash %}
(prompt) How many miles did you drive?
>20
(prompt) How many gallons of gas did you use?
>2
Your car gets 10.0 miles per gallon.
{% endhighlight %}
* save your file in SublimeText
* use status, add commit and push to save your file in version control and submit it

### \*numbers
(This one's hard!) Write a program that outputs the number in the thousands, hundreds, tens and ones places of a number. 

* using SublimeText, create a new file called __numbers.html__ in your repository directory: __~/Desktop/jversoza/lab-05-javascript/__
* setup an html file, and add script tags... start writing your JavaScript between the script tags
* ask the user for a number
* calculate the numbers in the thousands, hundreds, tens and ones places
* output each place to the JavaScript console
* one solution is to use some numeric operators to determine each place (maybe modulo, division and subtraction would help)
* you may have to calculate each place separately
* don't worry about input that's not a positive whole number below 10,000
* example interaction is below (everything after the greater than sign (&gt; is user input using the prompt function):
{% highlight bash %}
(prompt) Please enter a number
> 256

0 thousands
2 hundreds
5 tens
6 ones
{% endhighlight %}
* save your file in SublimeText
* use status, add commit and push to save your file in version control and submit it

### \*tree

(This one's slightly hard... try doing it in just one line!) Print out a tree!

* using SublimeText, create a new file called __tree.html__ in your repository directory: __~/Desktop/jversoza/lab-05-javascript/__
* setup an html file, and add script tags... start writing your JavaScript between the script tags
* print out an ascii art tree to the JavaScript console
<pre>
   /\
  /  \
  /  \
 /____\
   ||
</pre>
* save your file in SublimeText
* use status, add commit and push to save your file in version control and submit it
