## Y.  STILL MOAR PROCESSING. BUT...
</section>

<section markdown="block">
### Today's Topics

* just a couple of git and github related _newness_
	* copying an entire remote repo locally using git (__clone__)
	* copying someone else's github repo so that you can modify it (__forking__)
* a couple of new processing jams
	* __triangle__
	* __random__
* some familiar stuff, but more in-depth
	* __animation__ (more than one object, __parallax__)
	* __conditionals__ (well, we knew this)
	* __for loops__
</section>

<section markdown="block">
### Lab Grades

* posted on blackboard (please check!)
* each lab was worth __10__ points 
* dropped lowest lab grade
* only received 0 if you were absent and did not send in make-up work
* average was __9/10__!
* will send out averages and details end-of-week
	* (though you can probably calculate this yourself beforehand if you're curious)
</section>

### Module 1 - Commandline - Grading Details

* reviewed each lab, and...
* only took off points for skipped/unfinished questions
* lenient regarding answers (even if output was incorrect, still gave credit)
* (lab questions answered / total lab questions) * 10 points 
* rounded up!
* look for more details in blackboard
</section>

* +3 attendance and work		
* +1 working program (no syntax errors)		
* +2 program meets majority of specifications

### Extra Credit?

Yes.  Lab 5... 3rd drawing counted as extra credit.

* +1 attempting dog drawing
