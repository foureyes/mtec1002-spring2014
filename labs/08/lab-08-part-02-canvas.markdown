### radius

Write a program that asks for a number.  It will draw a circle with that radius.

* using SublimeText, create a new file called __radius.html__ in your repository directory: __~/Desktop/jversoza/lab-08-for/__
* setup an html file
* create a canvas element of at least 300 by 300
* add script tags... start writing your JavaScript between the script tags
* the program should ask for a radius: "Give me a radius"

<hr>

### five

Draw five squares using a for loop

* using SublimeText, create a new file called __five.html__ in your repository directory: __~/Desktop/jversoza/lab-08-for/__
* setup an html file
* create a canvas element of at least 300 by 300
