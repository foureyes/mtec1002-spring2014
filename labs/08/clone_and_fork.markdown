### Clone

If you want to copy a project so that you can look at the code or modify it... and the code is in an accessible repository, you can use __git clone__.

{% highlight java %}
git clone http://some/repository.git
{% endhighlight %}

* This will clone the remote repository to a local repository that you can work on! 
* We'll use this to retrieve saved work or lab templates from github
</section>

<section markdown="block">
### Fork

Github has a feature that lets you copy another user's repository (perhaps to contribute to the project or use it as a starting off point) into your list of remote github repositories.

If you're browsing another repository, you can click on fork to copy it!  You'll have it available as a repostiory that you can modify!

Demo: &rarr;

### Fork and Clone

To work on someone else's code ... and even some lab templates, you can:

1. fork a repository on github
2. clone that repository (using the url that you get from the repo page)

If you clone, you won't have to initialize a local repository or add a remote repository... those are already set for you!

Demo: &rarr;

### Adjusted Workflow

So... an adjusted workflow may be:

1. fork a repository on github
2. clone it
3. change code
4. add
5. commit
6. push to origin master
