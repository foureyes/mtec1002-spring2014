2. The program should ask for your name
3. Once the program has your name, it should use that name to ask another question...
4. Hi name!  How many cats do you have?
5. If the input is 0, then say...
6. Sorry name, that's just not enough cats
7. If the input is not 0, then calculate the number of cats + 1
8. Use the results of that calculation to say:
9. How about one more to make it result
10.Don't worry about non-numeric input for the second question

Example Output - Everything after the greater than sign (>) is user input:

Hi Joe!  How many cats do you have?

Sorry Joe, that's just not enough cats!
