days.py (4 points)
=====
This is a slight variation on 5.14 exercise 1 in THINKSCI. Assume the days of the week are numbered 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 from Sunday to Saturday. Write a program that asks the user for a number.  The program will print out the corresponding day.
1. Create a file called days.py
2. Ask the user for a number
3. Print out the appropriate day
4. You can get away with only using if-statements and the equality operator (but feel free to go ahead an use if/elif).
5. Don't worry about input outside of the range of numbers from 0 up-to and including 6.

Example Output - Everything after the greater than sign (>) is user input:

Please enter the number of your day
> 4
4 is... 
Thursday
