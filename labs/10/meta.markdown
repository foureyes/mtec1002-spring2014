### Grading

* first module (commandline) 
	* mostly checking to see if item was filled in
	* some items were questions, which were marked based on accuracy of answers
	* % completed * 7 points... gives the amount of points per class
* subsequent modules
	* each program was worth around 1 point each (with a few exceptions)
	* subtracted .25 for syntax errors / programs that did not run
	* extra credit / optional files were worth 0.25 more
