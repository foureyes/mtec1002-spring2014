### Our Next Module!

* __A _Whirlwind_ Tour of Processing__
* and... __VERSION CONTROL!!!__
	* (YES!)
	* (hopefully (more on this in a second))
</section>

<section markdown="block">
### Today's Topics

* just enough __processing__ to motivate the need for version control
	* I'm assuming some prior knowledge
	* this is _absolutely not_ a programming class
	* this is _absolutely not_ a Python class
	* it's mostly the stuff that programmers have to do that isn't actually programming
* a quick intro to __version control__ with __git__ and __github__
</section>

<section markdown="block">
### Specifically...

* __processing__
	* downloading, using the IDE
	* basics
	* variables, types
	* control structures
	* maybe some interaction
* __git__ and __github__
	* creating a github account
	* cloning repositories
	* adding, committing, and pushing changes
</section>

### However, There's One Wrinkle

The lab machines.  Let's check if git is installed. __Type the following in terminal__ (it doesn't matter what directory you're in, and ignore the $ prompt).

{% highlight bash %}
$ git --version
git version 1.7.3.2
{% endhighlight %}

## So, Is git Installed?  IF NOT LET ME KNOW!!!!

(I checked a few machines last week, and they seemed like they had old installed versions on them)
