### Our Next Module!

__VERSION CONTROL!!!__

* (YES!)
* (but it's actually just more stuff to learn on the commandline)
* (hopefully (more on this in a second))
</section>

<section markdown="block">
### And How?

To motivate the need for version control, we'll also cover:

* a bit more shell scripting
* just enough __JavaScript__ to write some basic programs:
	* this is _absolutely not_ a programming class
	* this is _absolutely not_ a JavaScript class
	* (it's mostly the stuff that programmers have to do that isn't actually programming)
</section>

<section markdown="block">
### Today's Topics

* a quick intro to __version control__ with __git__ and __github__
* a new way of submitting labs
* review 
* a few more commands 
* more about writing shell scripts
</section>

### However, There's One Wrinkle

The lab machines.  Let's check if git is installed. __Type the following in terminal__ (it doesn't matter what directory you're in, and ignore the $ prompt).

{% highlight bash %}
$ git --version
git version 1.7.3.2
{% endhighlight %}

## So, Is git Installed?  IF NOT LET ME KNOW!!!!
