### What is Processing?

* it's an open source programming language
* it's also an _IDE_ - integrated development environment
* meant for teaching programming
	* easy graphics programming provides instant feedback 
	* abstracts away complexities/tedium of other programming languages/environments

### What is Processing Really?

* it's actually built on top of Java... so _it's just Java!_
* as in... it's a subclass of a Java class
* _however_ ... everyone knows that Java Applets are _not cool_
* no, really](http://www.informationweek.com/security/vulnerabilities/oracle-issues-emergency-java-security-up/240147724)
* but ... don't worry, we're running it on the desktop
* also, there's [processing.js](http://processingjs.org/) (see [Khan Academy's cs track](http://www.khanacademy.org/cs/))
