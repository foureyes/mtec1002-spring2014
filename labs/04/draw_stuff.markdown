# Draw Stuff Lab!

In this lab, you'll be drawing three objects:

1. a face
2. a robot
3. a dog!

Some logistics:

* __save all of these in your mtec1002-lab04 folder first!__
* __save as the name of the thing that you're drawing__

## face
{% highlight java %}
// draw a green face with two eyes and a mouth
// not symmetrical
// don't forget eyeballs!

{% endhighlight %}

## robot
{% highlight java %}
// draw a gray robot that's centered horizontally
// should have a head, neck, body and two legs
// and a red sensor on its face! (awesome!)

{% endhighlight %}

// it should have eyes (one, profile)
// it should have ears (one, profile)

{% endhighlight %}
